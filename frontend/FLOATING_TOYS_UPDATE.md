# Floating Toys & Font Weight Updates

## New Features Added

### 1. Additional Toy Illustrations

Added 6 new custom SVG illustrations to make the site more playful:

- **TeddyBear** - Soft teddy bear with cute belly
- **Ball** - Striped toy ball
- **BuildingBlock** - LEGO-style building block with studs
- **Car** - Toy car with wheels
- **SmallDino** - Smaller version of dinosaur for decorations
- **Butterfly** - Colorful butterfly

All illustrations use the soft color palette and are fully responsive.

### 2. Floating Decorative Elements

The home page now has **10 floating toy elements** positioned around the screen:

- Small dinos (2x) - Top left and bottom right
- Moon - Top right
- Stars (2x) - Various positions
- Ball - Top middle-right
- Teddy bear - Bottom left
- Building block - Bottom right
- Butterfly - Right side
- Toy car - Bottom middle-left

**Animation Details:**
- All toys use the `animate-float` animation
- Different animation delays (0.3s to 2s) create a staggered effect
- Opacity ranges from 20-40% so they don't overpower the content
- Positioned using absolute positioning with Tailwind utilities

### 3. Reduced Font Weights

Made text more readable by reducing font weights across the app:

**Changed from Bold to Medium/Semibold:**
- H1: `font-bold` → `font-semibold`
- H2: `font-semibold` → `font-medium`
- H3: `font-semibold` → `font-medium`
- H4: Added with `font-medium`
- Card headers: `font-bold` → `font-medium`
- Primary buttons: `font-bold` → `font-semibold`
- Secondary buttons: `font-semibold` → `font-medium`
- Choice buttons: `font-semibold` → `font-normal`
- Labels: `font-semibold` → `font-medium`

**Results:**
- Much easier to read, especially in larger text sizes
- Still maintains hierarchy and visual interest
- More professional and modern appearance

## Files Modified

- `src/components/Illustrations.tsx` - Added 6 new toy SVGs
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - Added 10 floating decorations, reduced all font weights
- `src/styles/globals.css` - Reduced font weights in base styles and components

## Visual Impact

**Before:**
- Text was very bold and hard to read in large sizes
- Clean but minimal decorations
- Professional but a bit sterile

**After:**
- Text is softer and more readable
- Playful floating toys create whimsy
- Maintains professionalism while adding charm
- Better balance between fun and functional
